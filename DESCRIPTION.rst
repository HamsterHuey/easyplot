The EasyPlot module provides a thin wrapper to matplotlib, enabling fast and
easy generation of beautiful, annotated plots with minimal code. It also enables
the reuse of EasyPlot instances to generate new plots that maintain state from
previous plots allowing for quick and easy generation of multiple plots of the
same type. EasyPlot supports all commonly used plot parameters and allows access
to the underlying figure and axes instances to allow the user to further customize
the generated plots if necessary.

For more details and examples please see the included package documentation and
the IPython Notebook containing documentation and an extensive list of examples:
